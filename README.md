# Graph Algorithms for MIR

The purpose of this project is to explore a novel, graph-based approach to music
information retrieval (MIR). 
Songs are represented using a graph, and features are extracted from the graph
using various graph algorithms. 
These feature scan be used in machine learning applications, such as 
classification of song by genre or composer.
