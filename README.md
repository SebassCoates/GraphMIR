# Graph Algorithms for MIR

The purpose of this project is to explore a novel, graph-based approach to music
information retrieval (MIR). 
Songs are represented using a graph, and features are extracted from the graph
using various graph algorithms. 
These feature scan be used in machine learning applications, such as 
classification of song by genre or composer.

In my experiments, I was able to achieve .98 accuracy in a classical vs. jazz
genre classification problem. I was also able to achieve .98 accuracy in a Bach
vs. Chopin composer classification problem. A report summarizing my findings is
included in the repository (report.pdf).
